# dng_sdk_1.5.1_-_gpr_sdk_1.0.0
This is my inept attempt to merge some on the DNG SDKs included on github. DNG SDK library is needed to function for libRAW or GoPro GPR SDK. DNG SDK is always lossy because there hasn't color matirx option 'undefined' for RAW. DNG SDK in libRAW doesn't render colors well. libRAW doesn't produce compressed lossless files using family JPEG.
